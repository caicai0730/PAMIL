# Project Dataset Description  

## Dataset Overview  

This project utilizes the following two main datasets. The code corresponds to the research work published in *Pseudo-label attention-based multiple instance learning for whole slide image classification*:  

1. **Camelyon16 Dataset**  
   - **Source**: Camelyon16 Challenge Data  
   - **Purpose**: Used for training and testing pathology image detection models, primarily consisting of tissue slide images related to cancer detection.  
   - **Data Format**: High-resolution microscopic images stored in `.tif` or `.svs` formats.  

2. **TCGA Dataset**  
   - **Source**: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)  
   - **Purpose**: Used for cancer-related multimodal data analysis and model training, covering tissue samples and clinical data for various cancer types.  
   - **Data Content**: This dataset typically includes tissue slide images, gene expression data, and patient information for multimodal studies.
